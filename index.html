		<h3> About Me </h3>
		<p> I am a junior at The University of Tennessee at Martin majoring in Communications with a sequence in News Editorial. Besides going to classes, I am the co-news editor at The Pacer, the student-run newspaper at UTM. I am also an active member of UTM Bass and secretary for the UTM French Club. I have several hobbies and passions outside of school, including: hunting, fishing, hiking, photography, and pretty much anything to do with the great outdoors. </p>
		<p>  
I started my post secondary education at the University of Tennessee at Chattanooga, but soon realized I didn’t enjoy being away from home and transfered to UT Martin. In my time at Martin, I have met many wonderful people who have shaped my life for the better. By getting involved with The Pacer, I found the direction I want to head in my professional life. I have special interest in covering outdoor/wildlife news for an organization.
</p>
		<p> One of my biggest strengths is that I throughly enjoy writting and communicating with people. My biggest weakness would be advanced math, but i’m always up for a challenge. Besides my previous employment experiences, I have a strong skill set that would benefit your company. I would consider myself pretty computer savy, as I have experience in several adobe programs including; InDesign, Photoshop, Word, Excel, etc.  I have some basic experience in HTML and CSS and basic web design. I'm also bilingual, as I can communicate in basic french. I look forward to hearing from you! </p>
